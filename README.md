# Lec-JSDemo-ToDoList

This repository contains the outline to a create a client only To Do List website. 

For that purpose we will be using an HTML file, a CSS and a JS file. Instructions are included in the comments in each of the respective files. The best way to solve this activity is to start with the HTML file and then move on to the JS file and intermittently the CSS file to add style rules.

To run the solution, you have to download these files onto your local machine and double-click on the HTML file to open it in the browser.

If your solution is not working as expected, right-click on your page in the browser and click on the "inspect" option. That should pull up a developer pane. Go to the "console" tab to check if there are any errors. If you click on the error, it will take you to the exact line where the error is arising.

If you would like to see if the values/elements that you are parsing are being correctly fetched in Javascript, you can start by using console.log() to print to the console tab in the developer pane.

For further help, you may start by refering to w3schools or MDN's Javascript documentation. If you would like to work it out with a course staff, you are welcome to office hours.
